# IndieRadar — Reddit-first, AI‑scored opportunities (simulated samples)

**What**  
IndieRadar scans **Reddit** developer communities and turns posts into *actionable opportunity cards* with an AI demand score, type, urgency, and pay‑signal.  
This repo contains **simulated samples** and the output structure for reference. No real Reddit data is included.

**Why**  
So indie developers spend less time browsing and more time building.

**How (pipeline)**  
**Watch** (Reddit) → **Filter** (keywords + rules) → **Validate** (AI) → **De‑dupe** → **Deliver** (alerts/digest).
